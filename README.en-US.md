### Pro.5.x <font size="-2" color="gray">(Based on the original v0.6.0-beta.3 branch)</font>

#### Pro.5.3

##### ✨ New Features
- **🚀 Global Shortcut for Paste as Plain Text**: Completely refactored the "Paste as Plain Text" shortcut capability, breaking the limitation of in-app use only and officially upgrading it to a global shortcut. One-click paste of the latest clipboard content when the app is in the background, and paste selected content when in the foreground, offering much more flexibility.

##### 💫 Experience Optimizations
- **📊 Refactored Clipboard Type Recognition Engine**: Fixed the issue where copying data from office software (Excel/WPS) was mistakenly saved as an image when the "Copy as Plain Text" mode was enabled.
- **🎯 Smart Detection for Composite Table Data**: Addressing the extremely similar content characteristics when copying data from office software (Excel/WPS) vs. copying images from browsers, introduced a four-dimensional detection system to achieve absolutely precise targeting and clean extraction of office table data.
- **🧹 Auto-Cleanup of Temporary Table Files**: Automatically deletes useless temporary images after recognizing tables, preventing residual files on the disk.
- **🔘 Optimized Default Action Buttons**: Enabled 9 common quick actions by default and adjusted their order (Preferences → Clipboard → Action Buttons), comprehensively enhancing the out-of-the-box experience for new users.
- **🖱️ Optimized Word Selection Paste**: Renamed "Text Snippet Selection" to "Word Selection Paste" (Preferences → Clipboard → Action Buttons) for a more intuitive expression of the feature; moved its position below "Auto Paste" in the preferences for clearer configuration.
- **📊 Storage Stats View Space Optimization**: Deeply streamlined the redundant padding whitespace in the storage stats page, dynamically narrowing the font size and width of the left stats summary area to provide maximum visualization space for the horizontal charts.

##### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- **⌨️ Fixed Invalid Paste as Plain Text Shortcut**: Deeply refactored the underlying system-level key injection logic, resolving unresponsiveness caused by key anomalies during "Paste as Plain Text" and "Quick Paste", making paste operations more stable.
- **📈 Fixed Stats Chart Edge Overflow**: Completely fixed the layout overflow issue where the right-side content of the stats chart was forcibly pushed out of bounds under extremely narrow window sizes.
- **⏰ Storage Stats Time Picker Adaptive Fix**: Fixed the layout overflow issue where the exceedingly long date range selection box was pushed out of the window bounds when selecting a "Custom" time range.

#### Pro.5.2

##### ✨ New Features
- **📦 Local Data Filter Support**: A completely refactored local data export engine with powerful multi-dimensional filtering, supporting scope (All/Favorites) + 12 content types. The exported backup matches exactly the filtered contents and associated images, ensuring accurate and compact backups that can be seamlessly restored.
- **🏷️ Global Backup Naming Convention**: Unified the backup file naming convention for both WebDAV and local exports (`AppName.Timestamp.DeviceName.OS.Mode.Extension`). Introduced 4 clear backup modes: `full`, `lite`, `filter`, and `favs` (Favorites only) for more organized file management.
- **📥 Drag and Drop Backup Import**: Added the ability to directly drag and drop local backup files to restore data. Following a successful import, the clipboard list is automatically refreshed instantly, achieving a seamless restoration without manual application restart.
- **⌨️ Double-Click Modifier Key Activation**: Expanding beyond traditional keyboard shortcuts, this feature introduces the ability to open the clipboard window by double-tapping a modifier key (`Ctrl`, `Alt`, or `Shift`). The settings panel has been updated with a clear 'Record / Double-Click' segmented control, elegantly separating spatial shortcuts from time-based double-clicks for an intuitive configuration process.

##### 💫 Experience Optimizations
- **✂️ Automatic Edge Space Trimming**: When copying emails, links, paths, or color values, any accidental leading or trailing white spaces are intelligently stripped. This prevents such content from being misclassified as generic `Plain Text`, guaranteeing accurate type recognition.
- **🎨 Refined Code Syntax Highlighting**: Upgraded code syntax highlighting with customized color schemes mirroring the professional aesthetics of VS Code, vastly improving readability. Implemented subtle UI refinements to smoothly blend code blocks with content cards for an immersive reading experience.
- **🔄 Seamless Import & Restore Hot Reloading**: Comprehensively overhauled the data loading mechanisms used when `Importing Backup Files` and `Restoring from WebDAV`. This enables an instantaneous, non-disruptive hot reloading experience where the clipboard history refeshes immediately after data recovery, eliminating the need to restart the application.
- **🛡️ Precise Clipboard Change Detection**: Optimized background listener logic to intelligently filter out "false copy" events triggered by third-party applications or the OS. The application now solely reacts to authentic clipboard content modifications, running smoother and more reliably in the background.
- **🔍 Enhanced Source Recognition for Duplicate Copies**: When copying the exact same text or image across different applications sequentially, the source application's icon and name are now accurately updated, and the repeated item properly returns to the top of the list, providing a behavior that aligns perfectly with user intuition.
- **🔒 Prevent Erroneous Modifications to Source Activity**: Resolved an issue in `Auto Sort` mode where a paste operation would inaccurately alter an existing clipboard record's source application, ensuring absolute fidelity in historical origin tracking.
- **📊 Preserved Table Border Rendering**: When copying tabular data from applications like Excel, a safe, native, and non-conflicting base gridline styling is intelligently injected to exponentially increase the structural integrity and readability of the data presentation inside the application.
- **✂️ Optimized HTML Content Rendering**: Addressed the issue of excessive, unused vertical padding appearing at the top and bottom of list cards when copying certain HTML content. Irrelevant white space is now automatically pruned to deliver a clean, compact, and beautiful layout.

##### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- **📧 Resolved Empty Email Group Display**: Fixed a stubborn issue where selecting the `Email` group occasionally displayed an empty list, failing to render the genuinely categorized email records.
- **📌 Fixed Pinned Window Abnormal Closure Upon Pasting**: Completely resolved the behavioral bug where pasting content would forcibly and prematurely close the main clipboard window even when the `Pin Window (Stay on Top)` toggle was actively enabled.

#### M05.1

##### ✨ New Features (A New Space Manager Experience)
- **📊 Panoramic Chart View**
  - **📋 Multi-Dimensional Storage Stats Panel**: Added 12 core content types storage stats, visually displaying space usage; supports independent "All/Favorites" switching, allowing separate inspection of storage data for favorite records.
  - **⚡ Ultra-High-Performance Stats Engine**: Refactored the physical volume tracing and dashboard stats logic. Replaced blocking Disk IO traversal with unified memory-level database queries, allowing instant loading even with tens of thousands of records and hundreds of GBs of data.
  - **📈 Dynamic Visual Balancing Algorithm**: To handle significantly varying "long-tail data," adopted a square-root smoothing formula that ensures intuitive contrast while preventing small files from becoming "invisible."
  - **🎯 Panoramic Data Pass-Through Interaction**: Optimized the bar chart interaction area. Hovering now reveals a floating card in real-time displaying the corresponding correct item count and accurate volume.
- **⏳ Flexible Timeline Navigation**
  - **⏰ Global Intelligent Time Filtering**: Built-in time filter with support for `Today`, `Yesterday`, `Last 3 Days`, `This Week`, `This Month`, and `Custom` date ranges, instantly rendering storage data for the specified period.
  - **🔗 Fully Merged Module Response**: Time filtering perfectly synchronizes with statistical charts and detail lists. Switching times updates the visualization of data accumulations and trends instantly.
- **🧹 Intelligent Anti-Mistake Cleanup**
  - **🗑️ Typological Accurate Cleanup**: Supports multi-selection by content type for 1-click batch cleanup of `Unfavorited` / `Favorited` redundant history data.
  - **🖼️ Image Deep Correlated Cleanup**: When cleaning up images, alongside obliterating database fingerprints, the system now simultaneously supports "synchronous deletion of local image files," genuinely freeing disk space and perfectly complementing custom storage paths.

##### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- **🌐 Web Link Identification Fix**: Optimized clipboard type judgment logic. URL/email addresses copied in plain text format will be forcibly recognized as plain text, resolving the issue where styled links copied from web pages were misidentified as HTML.
- **🎨 Color Code Misclassification Fix**: Refactored color recognition validation engine to only validate standard color values, preventing ordinary English words (e.g., `Tan`, `azure`, etc.) from being falsely recognized and highlighted.

##### 🐛 Upstream Bug Fixes
- **📂 File Icon Path Isolation Fix**: Deeply integrated the `tauri-plugin-fs-pro` underlying API. File icons will now precisely save into the user's custom directory and no longer leave redundant files in the system's default `AppData` path.

#### M05.0

#### ✨ New Features
- **📅 Multi-Dimensional Filtering**: Added combined "Date + Content Type" multi-dimensional filtering. Click the funnel icon at the top to open the filter panel. Supports three independent date filter modes — by day, by month, and custom date range — along with multi-select for 12 content type tags, enabling efficient and precise content inspection.
- **🧩 Code (SVG) Smart Detection**: Added intelligent SVG formatted content recognition at the code level, leveraging "regex pre-screening of component skeleton + DOMParser XML structure parsing" dual validation for security, with SVG results categorized under the explicit `Code (SVG)` label.
- **📌 Detail-Level Global Tooltip**: Hovering over any text area in a content item's header reveals comprehensive core attributes including source app, content type, character count (file size / resolution), creation time, and more for convenient detail inspection.

#### 💫 UX Optimization
- **📝 Adaptive Precise Time Display**: Refactored clipboard history time display logic. When relative time (e.g., "3 days ago") exceeds 3 days, it automatically switches to the `YY/M/D H:mm` absolute time format for clearer and more informative time tracing.
- **🧹 Top Controls Layout Reorganization**: Optimized the top layout of the search floating window by narrowing the search input width and front-loading the "Pin/Unpin" and "Preferences" action button groups for significantly improved access to high-frequency operations.
- **🏗️ Focus Management Full Rollback**: The "No-Focus Silent Window" and "Window Follows Caret Position" features have been fully reverted to the original v0.6.0-beta.3 implementation, removing the background polling threads and additional mount interfaces that relied heavily on the Win32 API, and restoring the main window's native focus capture mechanism.

#### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- **🚀 Group Switch on Activation Failure**: Completely resolved the issue where the "Preferences → Clipboard → Switch to All Groups on Window Activation" setting failed to take effect, ensuring the app strictly follows user-defined group rules upon activation.
- **📰 Composite Code Misclassification**: Completely fixed a priority override vulnerability where copying mixed "plain text code + HTML rich text semantics" fragments from IDEs or web pages caused content to be forcibly classified as `HTML` hypertext type, ensuring accurate recognition and classification of copied code.
- **🌐 HTML Code Misclassification**: Refactored the underlying HTML detection logic with regex compatibility for declaration headers and case-insensitive scenarios, completely resolving misclassification caused by skeleton validation failures and significantly improving detection accuracy.
- **📝 Markdown Misclassification**: Completely refactored the Markdown detection logic, upgrading to a composite intelligent engine with "core syntax positive weighting + illegal feature negative penalty + strict prefix boundary validation", effectively resolving issues where JS and other code snippets were misidentified as Markdown.
- **📋 JavaScript Code Misclassification**: Refactored the underlying code language detection engine, elevating JavaScript detection to the highest priority with targeted strong feature keywords for frontend build artifacts. Removed generic operators (`<<`, `>>`) from C++ detection rules that conflicted with JS shift operations, and added a JS feature "reverse kill" validation mechanism, completely resolving the persistent issue of obfuscated/minified frontend JS production code being misidentified as "Code (C++)".
- **🗑️ Legacy Garbage Cleanup**: Performed deep comparison and thorough cleanup of residual temporary files from deprecated mounts, eliminating redundant data interference with future feature refactoring from the root.

#### 🐛 Upstream Bug Fixes
- **👁️ Full-Width Item Header Release**: Removed the original UI behavior of forcibly reserving fixed width for invisible action buttons on the right side. In unselected state, the record header attribute bar now achieves 100% full-width display, providing more content space and more complete information presentation.

### M04.x <font size="-2" color="gray">(Based on original v0.6.0-beta.3 branch)</font>

#### M04.6

##### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- **🔀 Group Switching Content Display Anomaly**: Fixed a race condition where rapidly switching groups in the clipboard window displayed incorrect content, caused by subsequent group click requests being discarded while the component was in a loading state.

#### M04.5

##### 🏗️ Architecture Optimization
- **🛡️ Downward Compatibility Hardening**: Implemented the robustness principle of "conservative in what you send, liberal in what you accept", resolving crash issues during version downgrades caused by data structure incompatibilities.
- **🗄️ Database Query Safeguard**: Refactored the database query layer utilizing a "Unified Column Definition → On-Demand Query" architecture, driven solely by the `historyColumnDefs` data source for both table creation and querying. Lower versions will automatically ignore unknown columns added by higher versions, completely eliminating downgrade crashes caused by structural differences.
- **⚙️ Config Processing Safeguard**: Added the `strictDeepAssign` strict deep-merge mechanism. Config sync now only accepts options defined in the current version. Unknown config fields written by higher versions will be silently discarded, preventing rendering anomalies caused by state pollution.

##### 💫 UX Optimization
- **🎨 Text Selection Highlight Tuning**: Changed the selected text highlight background color in the clipboard to a softer blue `#4096FF`, and set the text color to white `#FFFFFF`.
- **📍 "Back to Top" Button Position Tuning**: Standardized the position of the "Back to Top" button in the bottom right corner of the clipboard window, keeping its bottom and right margins equal.

##### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- **📋 Source App Tracking Fix**: Fixed an issue where, with `autoSort` enabled, the source icon/name of the latest clipboard item incorrectly reflected the currently active window rather than the original copying app. The app info from the original copy event is now preserved.
- **💥 Downgrade Crash Fix**: Fixed a rendering crash (`Cannot destructure property 'key'`) that occurred when downgrading from a higher version to a lower version due to extra database fields in the clipboard window (effective for current and future versions).

#### M04.4

##### ✨ New Features
- **✂️ Support for Text Snippet Selection**: You can select specific text snippets within the clipboard window and quickly perform "Copy / Paste" operations using the auto-popping floating toolbar or enhanced context menu. Supports `Plain Text`, `Rich Text`, and `HTML` types.
- **🔛 Text Snippet Selection Toggle**: You can independently enable or disable partial text selection as needed (Preferences → Content Settings → Text Snippet Selection).

#### M04.3

##### ✨ New Features
- **🎨 CMYK Color Detection**: Added smart extraction and preview support for CMYK color formats.

##### 💫 UX Optimization
- **🖱️ Context Menu Refactoring**:
